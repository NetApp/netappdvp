# NetApp Docker Volume Plugin

The NetApp Docker Volume Plugin (nDVP) provides direct integration with the Docker ecosystem for NetApp's SolidFire, ONTAP, and E-series storage platforms. The nDVP package supports the provisioning and management of storage resources from  storage platforms to Docker hosts.

Multiple instances of nDVP can run concurrently on the same host.  This allows simultaneous connections to multiple storage systems and types, with the ablity to customize the storage used for the Docker volume(s).

Detailed documentation can be found on [Read the Docs](http://netappdvp.readthedocs.io).

nDVP can also be deployed directly from the [Docker Store](https://store.docker.com/plugins/netapp-docker-volume-plugin-ndvp).
